# Blacklist. Used to selectively prevent usernames, hostnames,
# IP addresses and IP ranges from connecting.
#
# The format is <username>@<hostname>: [<ip1>, <ip2>, <ip3>]
#
# The hostname can be omitted: User: [<ip1>, <ip2>].
#
# An IP address can be used in place of a hostname if only one IP
# needs to be blacklisted.
#
# List multiple IPs after the colon, separated by commas:
# BadUser@host.name: [1.2.3.4, 111.111.222.222, 112.112.*.*]
# IP ranges are supported.
#
# Example list:
#
# BadPlayer:
# Griefer@111.111.222.222:
# Spambot@spamhost.name: [222.222.*.*]
# IMFAgent@cia.gov: [10.0.0.1, 21.1.0.0]
# 666@cultof.vi:
#
# Use [] if there are no entries.
